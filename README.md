# GIS-E15-Refinery-Analysis

This repository contains the final research poster for my GIS project analyzing
how proximity to ethanol refineries relates to county-level retail gasoline prices
in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, and Missouri. The project integrates spatial analysis
in ArcGIS Pro with statistical analysis in R, including distance calculations,
county-level gas price data from AAA, and regression modeling with state controls.

The attached poster summarizes the motivation, data sources, methods, and key findings.
